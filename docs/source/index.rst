Welcome to Pathfinder Framework's documentation!
================================================

The "pathfinder_framework" library is a way of representing the underlying entities that exist in the `Pathfinder Framework <https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/SOS-1.5/Resources/Pathfinder-Framework-Version-2.0>`_. It can be used to develop applications that assist in aiding carbon transparency in supply chains.

It is developed by `ZeroTwentyFifty <https://www.zerotwentyfifty.com/>`_, we are a software company dedicated to enabling organisations to create carbon transparency in their supply chains, which we support through our open source efforts on libraries like this, as well as our flagship and eponymous open source project, `ZeroTwentyFifty <https://github.com/ZeroTwentyFifty/zero_twenty_fifty>`_, which is an open source implementation of the `PACT Pathfinder Data Exchange Protocol <https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2/>`_.

If you would like to understand more about the work we do, what the Pathfinder Network aims to achieve, and how we are helping get organisations to a place of Carbon Transparency, please check our blog, which we update very regularly with educational content to improve understanding of the ecosystem: `ZeroTwentyFifty Blog <https://www.zerotwentyfifty.com/blog>`_.
